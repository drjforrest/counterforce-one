## üî¨ Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Source:** Reddit API (PRAW)
- **Time Period:** 2024-2025
- **Selection Criteria:** Health-related discussions in target communities
- **Ethical Approval:** Public data, de-identified analysis

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Scraping & Storage**
   - PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
   - Multilingual content support
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search

2. **Content Classification**
   - LGBTQ+ content classifier
   - Health misinformation scorer
   - Language detection

3. **Network Analysis**
   - User interaction graphs
   - Community detection algorithms
   - Centrality metrics (knowledge brokers)

4. **Human Annotation**
   - Ground truth dataset (4 key posts)
   - Accuracy labeling
   - Severity assessment
   - Community response coding

### Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, PostgreSQL, pgvector
- **ML/NLP:** Transformers, sentence-transformers
- **Network Analysis:** NetworkX
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Gradio
- **Data Collection:** PRAW (Reddit API)

    """Highlight key findings"""
    return """
## üí° Key Findings (Preliminary)

### 1. Community Self-Correction is Common

Even when misinformation is posted, communities often correct it organically:

- **Example:** The "U=U" post (2,268 upvotes) accurately describes HIV science, but the top comment (1,818 upvotes) adds important nuance about trust and adherence
- **Pattern:** High-quality information gets amplified, with community adding protective context

### 2. Subtle Misinformation is Harder to Combat

The "HIV is life altering" post shows how partially accurate information can be misleading:

- ‚úÖ Contains real science (gut damage, lymphatic effects)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Legitimate PubMed citations
- ‚ùå But: alarmist framing suggests treatment doesn't work well
- **Community Response:** Mixed - some validate lived experience, some question authenticity

### 3. Peer Support Networks Are Strong

The "recently diagnosed" post (523 upvotes, 68 comments) demonstrates:

- Overwhelmingly supportive responses
- Knowledge brokers (30+ year survivors) educate newly diagnosed
- Practical advice flows naturally
- Emotional support + accurate health info combined

### 4. Knowledge Gaps Persist

The PrEP/condoms discussion reveals:

- Some community members don't understand PrEP limitations (only prevents HIV, not other STIs)
- But: Community self-corrects with education about gonorrhea, other risks
- Demonstrates need for ongoing health education

---

## üéØ Research Impact

### For Public Health
- Understand how health information spreads in online communities
- Identify influential community members for health promotion
- Design better interventions that work WITH community dynamics

### For Platform Design
- Detect misinformation patterns early
- Amplify accurate peer education
- Support community resilience features

### For Vulnerable Communities
- Document community strengths (not just vulnerabilities)
- Validate peer support as health resource
- Inform culturally competent health communication

- [ ] Annotate 20-30 posts for robust ground truth
- [ ] Train ML classifier on annotated data
- [ ] Expand network analysis to all 30 top posts
- [ ] Calculate inter-rater reliability

### Short Term (1-2 Months)
- [ ] Temporal analysis: how does misinformation spread over time?
- [ ] Knowledge broker analysis: who are the key educators?
- [ ] Intervention design: what community features reduce misinformation?

### Long Term (3-6 Months)
- [ ] Cross-platform comparison (Reddit vs other social media)
- [ ] Automated early warning system for misinformation
- [ ] Partnership with public health organizations
- [ ] Academic publication

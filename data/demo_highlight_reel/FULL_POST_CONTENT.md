> In a medical setting undetectable means >200 VL, although on the regular tests undetectable will show as >40 VL.

### Top Community Responses:

**Comment 1 (1,818 upvotes):**
> You know, trusting the person actually is keeping up with their treatment.
>
> Don't put your health in someone else's hands, stay protected!

**Comment 2 (414 upvotes):**
> It actually DOES depend on the person taking their meds the proper way. And, as always when discussing STI status, not lying their ass off.

**Comment 3 (203 upvotes):**
> Now do a dozen other STIs
>
> Stay protected bros

**Comment 4 (186 upvotes):**
> Yeah I don't trust peopleâ€¦so if I do that only with prep/condomsâ€¦

**Comment 5 (128 upvotes):**
> Trust, but verify (or take your own precautions).
>
> While I know that U = U, if the person is just a hook-up and we're not all that familiar with each other, I'm going to err on the side of caution.
>
> If we've had a few dates, we've talked about it, I know what your medication regimen is, etc., then...

### Analysis Notes:

- **Scientific Accuracy:** U=U is endorsed by CDC, WHO, NIH - scientifically accurate
- **Community Response:** Mixed - some reinforce the science, many emphasize caution/trust issues
- **Key Insight:** Even when accurate info is shared, community adds important nuance about trust, other STIs, personal risk assessment
- **Demo Value:** Shows community resilience - not blindly accepting, but adding protective context

## POST 2: "HIV is life altering whether your on treatment or not (What they don't tell you)"

### Full Post Text:

> There's a popular mantra floating around: *"Just take your pill once a day and everything will be fine."* And while it's true that antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV into a manageable condition for many, the truth is much more nuanced â€” and for some of us, far more complicated.
>
> This post is meant to be informative, not for fear mongering. I just hate how dismissed this is, despite everything that comes with the condition (speaking first hand).

> Here's what rarely gets discussed:
>
> ## 1. Your Gut Takes a Hit â€” Early and Possibly Permanently
>
> HIV causes massive **damage to the gut lining** within days of infection. Over 50% of the body's immune cells are in the gut, and HIV decimates this population early. Even with treatment, the **mucosal barrier may never fully heal**, leaving some people with long-term issues like:
>
> - Chronic diarrhea
> - Food intolerances
> - Microbial imbalances (dysbiosis)
> - Low-grade inflammation
> - Leaky gut, which may fuel systemic immune activation
>
> ## 2. Lymphatic System Damage Is Real
>
> HIV infects lymph nodes early on, leading to **fibrosis** (scar-like stiffening) that traps immune cells â€” including CD4 T-cells â€” and prevents them from circulating effectively. This can contribute to:
>
> - Persistent low CD4 counts, even with viral suppression
> - Night sweats
> - Poor immune surveillance
> - Swelling or tenderness in lymph-rich areas
>
> The damage is often **irreversible**, especially in those diagnosed late or after years without treatment.
>
> ## 3. Some Viruses Don't Stay Quiet
>
> People living with HIV are more vulnerable to **latent viruses** like:
>
> - **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**
> - **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**
> - **HHV-8 (associated with Kaposi's Sarcoma)**
> - **Herpesviruses in general**
>
> These viruses can reactivate even on ART, especially when the immune system is weakened or recovering. This can lead to fatigue, pain, inflammation, and even organ involvement.
>
> ## 4. You Can Be Virally Undetectable and Still Feel Unwell
>
> Not everyone feels "normal" on ART. Some live with:
>
> - Chronic fatigue
> - Muscle or joint pain
> - Brain fog or cognitive changes
> - Mood shifts or depression
> - Sleep disturbances
>
> This doesn't mean ART isn't working. It means the body has been through **a lot**, and **not all damage is reversible**, even if the virus is "controlled."
>
> ## 5. The Stigma + Medical Gaslighting Compound the Damage
>
> Some providers dismiss lingering symptoms if your viral load is undetectable. Some online communities shame people who say they don't feel great, accusing them of fearmongering or exaggeration. But the reality is: [text appears cut off in database]

**Comment 2 (173 upvotes):**
> ðŸ’¯ this. I find that the community sometimes passes HIV off as if it's not a big deal. It's a life long condition!! Personally I don't have to take meds every day. And guess what? I don't want to!

**Comment 3 (155 upvotes):**
> Reading this currently on one week of PeP treatment after that one guy fucked me hard just to tell me later he doesn't do tests and he's basically slept around with the entire town in the last 5 years (I consented to it so it's my own fault lol I'm aware)

**Comment 4 (106 upvotes):**
> Reading this on day 10 of PEP after being stealthed is definitely an experience lol
>
> In all seriousness though, thank you OP for this post, HIV discourse online is so polarized, you're either bombarded with the stigma which makes it feel like it's still the 1980s or met with complete dismissal

**Comment 5 (55 upvotes):**
> ChatGPT to the rescue. Posts like this, with no citations or sources should be taken with a grain of salt.

### Analysis Notes:

- **Scientific Accuracy:** COMPLEX - Contains real science (gut damage, lymphatic fibrosis) but potentially overstates permanence and universality
- **Sources:** Author cites 5 PubMed Central articles (legitimate medical sources)
- **Tone:** Title is alarmist ("What they don't tell you") but body is more balanced
- **Community Response:** Mixed - some validate lived experience, one questions if it's AI-generated
- **Key Controversy:** Balances between "HIV is manageable" vs "HIV has real impacts" - both can be true
- **Demo Value:** Perfect example of subtle misinformation - NOT false, but possibly exaggerated/missing context

### Full Post Text:

> i 21M was recently diagnosed with hiv last month by a doctor as a major consequence for being reckless and not protecting myself beforehand. i never used nor ever obtained PrEP nor doxyPEP since i feared i would be caught by my family and i was afraid they would assume i was taking some hardcore shit since they didn't know anything about it. the reason why i was hooking up with more guys than usual was because i felt lonely since i couldn't make any friends at my new university and beforehand i struggled making new friends because i had a fear that those new friends i would potentially have would be the same as my old friend group that belittled me and made me feel like shit. another reason why i resorted to hooking up with random guys more than usual was because i didn't believe that i was ever gonna find a bf. i felt i was living in a world of never gonna happen when everyone else was living in a world of maybe one day. i refused and still refuse to accept being single and finding comfort in solitude. when i first found out i had HIV in my system, i felt like the weakest person alive. it sucks to be plagued with disease by a type of culture that is very pervasive within us gays that leaves me fighting hard every single day

**Comment 2 (142 upvotes):**
> I'm sorry this happened but HIV is very treatable (though not curable). You'll just take a pill everyday. I have mine right next to my bed so it's the first thing I do every morning. This helps me to remember. It is important you take these meds so you don't get sick. If you take your meds consistently...

**Comment 3 (71 upvotes):**
> We are closer to a cure than we have ever been. Hold out for hope and rejoice in the fact that the modern treatment for HIV is very minimal. You'll be just fine. (:

**Comment 4 (39 upvotes):**
> I'm sorry that happened to you - though a little surprised that you point fingers of blame at everyone and everything other than yourself: in an age when condoms and PreP are (comparatively) easily available, it is ultimately every adult's job to decide how safe to keep themselves (and live with the...

**Comment 5 (27 upvotes):**
> I (35) was diagnosed early Feb 2024 after 3 weeks of being the most ill I've ever been (lost 12 kilos). My best friend left work early to meet me at hospital and when he got there we had the briefest little cry before he killed off any shame or sadness or desire to cry for longer by quipping 'omg I'...

### Full Post Text:

> It's pride week where I am, and I've had three or four separate occasions where the topic of condoms has come up. Once on Grindr, twice in person.
>
> Often with the other person seemingly surprised that I'd want to use them when prep exists. One guy even asked if I was secretly married because I wanted to use protection.
>
> I've also had hot dilfs who'd been otherwise very involved in the flirting turn me down after I specified I'd want to use condoms, and they always say it like they're waiting for me to slip on my standards one day and go "oh well, fine. Just this once, because the dicks worth it"

### Top Community Responses:

**Comment 1 (388 upvotes):**
> Nothing to be ashamed about here. Your choices matter. No compromise necessary. Hard to believe anyone would question your protection decisions. Look after yourself however you need to.

**Comment 2 (203 upvotes):**
> Just your regular reminder that not only does drug resistant gonorrhea exist, but it's on the rise.

**Comment 3 (96 upvotes):**
> I was a f****** magnet for STDs when I was single (before PrEP was a thing). I wore a condom 98% of the time and almost every time I didn't I caught something.
>
> The very last time I caught chlamydia was because I stupidly kept penetrating the guy after cumming to finish him off. I started to go...

**Comment 4 (85 upvotes):**
> I'm on prep and doxy. I prefer raw. But if they want to use condoms I'm not gonna stop them. I'm still getting off either way. Whatever makes you comfortable.
